This constitutive fiber model has an initial exponential rise and then grows linearly after a user-specified stretch transition point. This fiber material is based on the trans-iso Mooney-Rivlin model introduced in [^1]. This material by itself is not stable, so it is recommend to use it as part of a solid mixture. 

The strain energy is as follows: 

\[
F_{2}\left(\tilde{\lambda}\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \tilde{\lambda}<1\\
C_{3}\left(e^{-C_{4}}\left(\text{Ei}\left(C_{4}\tilde{\lambda}\right)-\text{Ei}\left(C_{4}\right)\right)-\ln\tilde{\lambda}\right) & 1\le\tilde{\lambda}<\lambda_{m}\\
C_{5}\left(\tilde{\lambda}-\lambda_{m}\right)+C_{6}\ln\frac{\tilde{\lambda}}{\lambda_{m}}+C_{3}\left(e^{-C_{4}}\text{Ei}\left(C_{4}\lambda_{m}\right)-\text{Ei}\left(C_{4}\right)-\ln\lambda_{m}\right) & \lambda_{m}\le\tilde{\lambda}
\end{cases}\,
\]

where $\text{Ei}\left(\cdot\right)$ is the exponential integral function. The resulting fiber stress is evaluated from

\[
\tilde{\lambda}\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial\tilde{\lambda}}=\begin{cases}
0 & \tilde{\lambda}\leqslant1\\
C_{3}\left(e^{C_{4}\left(\tilde{\lambda}-1\right)}-1\right) & 1<\tilde{\lambda}<\lambda_{m}\\
C_{5}\tilde{\lambda}+C_{6} & \tilde{\lambda}\geqslant\lambda_{m}
\end{cases}\,.
\]

Here, $\lambda_{m}$ is the stretch at which the fibers are straightened, $C_{3}$ scales the exponential stresses, $C_{4}$ is the rate of uncrimping of the fibers, and $C_{5}$ is the modulus of the straightened fibers. $C_{6}$ is determined from the requirement that the stress is continuous at $\lambda_{m}$ (see below).

While this material enforces continuity of the strain energy density and stress at $\lambda_{m}$, it does not enforce continuity of the elasticity. To enforce continuity of all three parameters, we need to let

\[
C_{3}=\frac{C_{5}}{C_{4}}e^{-C_{4}\left(\lambda_{m}-1\right)}
\]

The parameter $C_{6}$ is chosen so that the stress defined above is continuous $\lambda_{m}$ and is determined by,

\[
C_{6}=C_{3}\left(e^{C_{4}\left(\lambda_{m}-1\right)}-1\right)-C_{5}\lambda_{m}
\]

To enforce continuity of the elasticity at $\lambda_{m}$ the user may also set $C_{3}=0$ in the input file, and specify $C_{4}$ and $C_{5}$ as explained above. When $C_{3}=0$ the code will automatically recalculate $C_{3}$ internally. Using the above formula to calculate $C_{3}$ manually for use in the first form can also enforce continuity of the elastic modulus at $\lambda_{m}$.
